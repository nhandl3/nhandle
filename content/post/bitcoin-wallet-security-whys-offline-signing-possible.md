There are two topics that audiences doubt me the most when I talk about Bitcoin.
First, Bitcoin coined the concept: Be Your Own Bank. Audiences, especially who new to Bitcoin will question what happen if my computer shutdown or go offline? What if someone transfer to me in the mean while?
Second is when I introduce about security of Bitcoin. Hackers all around the world want your money and can scam you through the internet. This is true for both credit card, online wallet, online account, .etc. And with Bitcoin you can store it offline, ha, so brilliant, if it is totally offline, no one can touch your treasure. But he or she will hard to believe it can happen. Again, no one can send coins to me. If I want to spend, I have to take it out, I then go to online and show up to the whole world, fair.

No, no, no.
I will tell them, you not store (and protect) your coins but actually, your private keys.
